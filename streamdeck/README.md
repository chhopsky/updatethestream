# Stream Deck Plugin for UDTS


# How to contribute:
Copy the `com.chhtv.udts.sdPlugin folder` into your Stream Deck Plugins folder (Default is `C:/Program Files/Elgato/StreamDeck/Plugins`). When you launch StreamDeck, the UDTS buttons will be at the very bottom under `Custom`

# Included Buttons:

Team 1 - Press this button to give Team 1 a win. The name of the button will dynamically update with Team 1's name.

Team 2 - Press this button to give Team 2 a win. The name of the button will dynamically update with Team 2's name.

Swap Red/Blue - Swaps Red/Blue sides

Force Update - Attempts to update Team 1 and Team 2's state. Useful if you open StreamDeck before UDTS.

Undo - Undo's last result. 


# NOTE: 
Using this plugin as instructed is intended for development purposes only. When we're happy with the state of the plug-in, we'll package the plugin with Elgato's DistributionTool.
